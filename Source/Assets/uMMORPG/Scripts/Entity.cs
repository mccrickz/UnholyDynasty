// The Entity class is rather simple. It contains a few basic entity properties
// like health, mana and level that all inheriting classes like Players and
// Monsters can use.
//
// Entities also have a _target_ Entity that can't be synchronized with a
// SyncVar. Instead we created a EntityTargetSync component that takes care of
// that for us.
//
// Entities use a deterministic finite state machine to handle IDLE/MOVING/DEAD/
// CASTING etc. states and events. Using a deterministic FSM means that we react
// to every single event that can happen in every state (as opposed to just
// taking care of the ones that we care about right now). This means a bit more
// code, but it also means that we avoid all kinds of weird situations like 'the
// monster doesn't react to a dead target when casting' etc.
// The next state is always set with the return value of the UpdateServer
// function. It can never be set outside of it, to make sure that all events are
// truly handled in the state machine and not outside of it. Otherwise we may be
// tempted to set a state in CmdBeingTrading etc., but would likely forget of
// special things to do depending on the current state.
//
// Entities also need a kinematic Rigidbody so that OnTrigger functions can be
// called. Note that there is currently a Unity bug that slows down the agent
// when having lots of FPS(300+) if the Rigidbody's Interpolate option is
// enabled. So for now it's important to disable Interpolation - which is a good
// idea in general to increase performance.
//
// Note: in a component based architecture we don't necessarily need Entity.cs,
//       but it does help us to avoid lots of GetComponent calls. Passing an
//       Entity to combat and accessing entity.health is faster than passing a
//       GameObject and calling gameObject.GetComponent<Health>() each time!
