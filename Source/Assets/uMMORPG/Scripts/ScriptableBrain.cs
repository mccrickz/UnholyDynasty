// Entity finite state machines are scriptable. This way it's very easy to
// modify monster/pet/player behaviours without touching core code.
// -> also allows for multiple monster AI types, which is always nice to have.

// ScriptableBrains have a completely open architecture. You can use other
// ScriptableObjects for states, you can use other AI assets, visual editors,
// etc. as long as you inherit from ScriptableBrain and overwrite the two Update
// functions!
// -> this is the most simple and most open solution.
